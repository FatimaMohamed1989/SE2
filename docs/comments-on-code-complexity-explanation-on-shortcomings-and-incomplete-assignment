My code turned out to be very complex, it took quite some time to fix all the errors that occurred
due to my lack of knowledge of python libraries as well as the difficulties I had with imports
I was able to get my script working by debugging each line that was causing trouble and then researching
errors as they appeared. In the end I feel that had my classes been in separate files it would have been easier to debug.

I was unable to get my program to work on my EC2 due to time constraints and software issues and instead of creating
tests i used the eclipse debug feature in order to check for errors.
